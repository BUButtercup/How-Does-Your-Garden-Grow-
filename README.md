# How-Does-Your-Garden-Grow
This app helps the Pacific Northwest Gardener to design a square-foot vegetable garden for their backyard.



## Description

We've created a website that allows users to generate a plan for their backyard vegetable garden. Using p5.js we generate a visual plan for a vegetable garden based on the area given by the user and with best gardening practices in mind. The user can then pick from a list which veggies they would like to plant, after this step is completed the user can click the build button to have the garden plan generated.

## How-to-use:
To use the app, simply:
1. Create a profile on [Emerald Thumb](https://serene-dusk-36944.herokuapp.com/). Once you're in, you will be taken to the main landing page. 
2. From the landing page select "Create New Garden." Complete the form: you will be asked to provide measurements of the bed you intend to use and then select vegetables from the list.
3. The app calculates the number of square feet you have available, and indicates to you how many square feet areas you have to fill, along with how many of each type of vegetable you can fit into one square foot area.
4. Once you click the "Build" button at the botton of the form, you will be taken to your plan, which will also provide you with the number of each type of vegetable you will need to fulfill it, as well as links to an information page about the vegetables you selected. You are able to download, email, or print this plan.
5. Each plan you create is saved in your "Old Gardens" section, soo you may re-use, edit, or delete them at your leisure.

## Future Development
There are several opportunities for increased value with this application:
* Expand upon the pre-seeded library of vegetables
* Allow users to create their own libraries of vegetables and other veg-friendly plants
* Offer additional shapes of garden 
* Offer additional styles of garden
* Offer seasonal garden options
* Offer additional information about each vegetable: harvest yield, etc.
* Generate a planting calendar
* Creating in-house resource materials for the plants chosen.
