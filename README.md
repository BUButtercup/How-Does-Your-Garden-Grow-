# How-Does-Your-Garden-Grow
Second project for UW full stack code bootcamp

## Description

We've created a website that allows users to generate a plan for their backyard vegetable garden. Using p5.js we generate a visual plan for a vegetable garden based on the area given by the user and with best gardening practices in mind. The user can then pick from a list which veggies they would like to plant, after this step is completed the user can click the build button to have the garden plan generated.

## How-to-use:
To use simply create a profile on [Greenthumb](https://), once created you will be taken to the main landing page. From the landing page select the 'Create New Garden', to complete the form the user will be asked to provide measurements of the bed they intend to use. The user then selects their desired veggies from the list, and then clicks the build button to have a garden bed plan generated.
